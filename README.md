# SkillNova

## Fresh Start
Due to the issues with the Canva site and all the messed up code, dependencies, etc. I am starting this from scratch.
The old code is still availabe in the **old-main** branch.

## Instructions for Neelav:Hostinger
* Just copy the files and paste them into it. If Hostinger refuses to shelter all the files, you can merge the HTML, CSS, and JS scripts as one.
* Absolutely do not touch the socket.io code and paste it.
* Same goes for `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, `package.json` or any other file outside `public` in general.
* For the files in the `public/assets` folder, if hostinger does not support it, upload it to a CDN network and modify the reference link in the HTML code.
