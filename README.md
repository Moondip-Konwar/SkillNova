# SkillNova

## Fresh Start
Due to the issues with the Canva site and all the messed up code, dependencies, etc. I am starting this from scratch.
The old code is still availabe in the **old-main** branch.

## Instructions for Neelav:Hostinger
1. Just copy the files and paste them into it. If Hostinger refuses to shelter all the files, you can merge the HTML, CSS, and JS scripts as one.
2. Absolutely do not touch the socket.io code and paste it.
3. For the files in the *public/assets* folder, if hostinger does not support it, upload it to a CDN network and modify the reference link in the HTML code.
